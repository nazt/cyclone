# Bitlash Commander

Bitlash Commander is a node.js web interface toolkit for Arduino.  It serves web pages containing buttons, sliders, and chart controls, easily customized, which trigger Bitlash scripts you specify to control the Arduino over the usb-serial link.  

Commander includes a graphical panel editing environment suitable for bringing up simple control panels without any coding, as well as a hands-on Javascript/HTML page development environment with plenty of examples for deep customization.

For documentation please see the Bitlash Commander wiki: https://github.com/billroy/bitlash-commander/wiki

Here are screenshots of some of the examples that ship with Commander:

Here is an overview of the architecture of Bitlash Commander:

The PC Serving and PC Viewing can be, and usually are, on the same PC; the server requires very modest system resources.


## Installing Bitlash on the Arduino

To start, you need to upload Bitlash to the Arduino.  

First, install the Bitlash library from GitHub into your Arduino library folder(see https://github.com/billroy/bitlash/wiki/install).

Second (after restarting the Arduino IDE), connect your arduino and perform these commands in the Arduino IDE:

	File -> Examples -> bitlash -> bitlashdemo
	File -> Upload

This wouldn't be a bad time to connect to Bitlash on the arduino using the Serial Monitor (at 57600 baud) and familiarize yourself with Bitlash a bit.  When you're done, close the Serial Monitor and continue here.

## Installing Bitlash Commander on the PC

# Install Prerequisites: node.js, git, build environment

You need node.js (http://nodejs.org) and optionally git (http://git-scm.com).  Do those installs, and return here.

It's a little easier to get the latest builds of Commander if you use the git method.  It's fine to proceed without git if you don't want the bleeding edge versions.

You also need a compiler and build environment for your platform so that the serial port driver will build successfully.  Follow the guidance for your platform here in the section titled "To Install" before proceeding: https://github.com/voodootikigod/node-serialport


# Install Bitlash Commander

Option 1: If you don't have git installed: in a new terminal window:

	$ npm install bitlash-commander
	$ cd node_modules/bitlash-commander
	$ node index.js


Option 2: If you do have git installed: in a new terminal window:

	$ git clone http://github.com/billroy/bitlash-commander
	$ cd bitlash-commander
	$ npm install
	$ node index.js


In either case, open a web browser on localhost:3000 to see the default control panel.

To start the web server on a different port:

	$ node index.js -p 8080

To specify a serial port for the arduino you would start it this way:

	$ node index.js -s /dev/tty.usbserial-F00D2321

Windows users will need to specify a com port using -s.  On Mac and Linux, the first usb arduino is used unless -s is specified.

To secure the server by requiring a login (edit the user/password table in index.js):

	$ node index.js -l

For help:	
	
	$ node index.js --help
	Usage: node ./index.js [flags]
	
	Options:
	  -p, --port        TCP port for the http server (3000)                    
	  -s, --serialport  port for usbserial arduino connection                  
	  -b, --baud        baud rate for usbserial arduino connection (57600)     
	  -c, --cache       load cached values on restart                          
	  -r, --redis       redis server url in redis-url format                   
	  -x, --rexec       set true to accept remote bitlash commands on socket.io
	  -l, --login       require a valid login to use the server                  [boolean]
	  -u, --update      allow HTTP updates via POST /update/:id/:value         


## Customize

Copy public/index.html to public/new.html and edit new.html to add your controls following the addButton / addSlider examples you will see there.  Then open new.html for testing:

	http://localhost:3000/new.html

Buttons display the value returned by Bitlash in their label.  Make sure your script causes Bitlash to print the output you'd like displayed.

There are many options you can set on the Button and Slider object, though mostly the defaults should work for you.  See Button.init() and Slider.init().

## The "Script" field

The script field of a control contains the Bitlash code you want executed when the button is pressed or the slider is moved.  The text of the script field is sent to Bitlash, and any reply from Bitlash is displayed by the control (if it's a Button).

Here is an example that toggles pin 13 and returns the value of pin 13 by printing it:

	{script:'d13=!d13;print d13'}


### Text substitution using Mustache

You can customize the script sent to Bitlash based on the current value of the control.

Here is an example that sets analog output 5 to the current value of the slider and prints it back as a response message:

	{script:'print a5={{value}}'}

You can use any field of the control object in {{}}.


## Pushing data from Bitlash

It is desirable to be able to update indicators on the control panel without action from the operator.  To do this, Bitlash Commander provides an upstream data channel from Bitlash to the controls on the various web pages open on the server.

To update a control using the upstream JSON channel you must know the control's id.  The easiest way is to assign one when you create the button in the .html file.  In this example from public/push.html, the button has the id 'millis':

	var Panel = new ControlPanel({color:'turquoise'});
	Panel.addButton({id:'millis', x:100, y:100, w:250, text:'millis'});

To update this control from Bitlash you would print a line of this form from a repeating background function:

	{"id":"millis","value":"33861"}

...where 'id' is the id of the control, "millis' in this case, and 'value' is the new value for the control.

Here is a Bitlash utility function to properly format JSON output for any id and value.   Copy and paste this definition into your Bitlash so you can use it below:

	function update {printf("{\"id\":\"%s\",\"value\":\"%d\"}\n", arg(1), arg(2));};

Here is an example of how to call update, and a startup function to trigger it every 1000 ms; copy and paste these, too:

	function pm { update("millis", millis); }
	function startup {run pm,1000;}

If you copy and paste those functions to your Bitlash, you can open the "push.html" file in the distribution to see the millis counter update in action.

	http://localhost:3000/push.html

## Listening for control updates

You can implement side-effects (like playing sounds or updating secondary controls) by listening for control updates.  

The push example in the file public/push.html shows event listeners in use:

	var Panel = new ControlPanel({color:'turquoise'});

	Panel.addButton({id:'millis', x:100, y:100, w:250, text:'millis', script:'print millis'});
	Panel.addButton({id:'clock',  x:100, y:180, w:250, text:'clock', script:''});
	Panel.addButton({id:'clock2', x:100, y:260, w:250, text:'clock2', script:''});

	Panel.controls['millis'].on('update', function(data) {
		Panel.controls['clock'].setValue(data.value);
	});

	Panel.controls['clock'].on('update', function(data) {
		Panel.controls['clock2'].setValue(data.value);
	});
